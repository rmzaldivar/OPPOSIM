# OPPOSIM
## Motivation

This repo creates a Python library that implements a data structure/concept called, "**O**rderly **P**aradigm **O**pen **S**ource **I**nference **M**odels" or OPOSIM. This structure is intended to simplify the creation, updating, handling, and understanding of most data models and ideally create an open source standard for researchers and practitioners to develop and share them as well.

## How to Help
The concept can be implemented in different languages and is meant to be fluid under the hood in implementations. 

If you would like to contribute language wise then I encourage alternate repos maybe loosely following the name scheme :) and please register an issue so that I can get in contact with you about supporting the project by contributing or discussing the idea behind OPOSIM.

If you have an idea regarding the design of the data structure please either create an issue that outlines the design change or create a branch with the alternative implementation and an explanation if you're cool ᕙ(▀̿̿Ĺ̯̿̿▀̿ ̿)ᕗ.
